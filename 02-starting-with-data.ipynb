    "## About Libraries\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",

    "Once a library is set up, it can be used or called to perform many tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas in Python\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An\n",
    "example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below."

    "# Reading CSV Data Using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by locating and reading our survey data which are in CSV format. CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values and is a common way store formatted data. Other symbols may also be used, so you might see tab-separated, colon-separated or space separated files. It is quite easy to replace one separator with another, to match your application. The first line in the file often has headers to explain what is in each column. CSV (and other separators) make it easy to share data, and can be imported and exported from many applications, including Microsoft Excel. For more details on CSV files, see the [Data Organisation in Spreadsheets](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/05-exporting-data/) lesson.\n",

    "A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different\n",
    "types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)\n",
    "in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in\n",
    "R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of\n",
