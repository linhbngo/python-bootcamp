The beauty\nof using a programming language like Python, though, comes from the ability to\nautomate data processing through the use of loops and functions.\n\n### For loops\n\nLoops allow us to repeat a workflow (or series of actions) a given number of\ntimes or while some condition is true. We would use a loop to automatically\nprocess data that's stored in multiple files (daily values with one file per\nyear, for example). Loops lighten our work load by performing repeated tasks\nwithout our direct involvement and make it less likely that we'll introduce\nerrors by making mistakes while processing each file by hand.\n\nLet's write a simple for loop that simulates what a kid might see during a\nvisit to the zoo:"
