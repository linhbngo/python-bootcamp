    "### Questions:\n",
    "  - \"What types of data can be contained in a DataFrame?\"\n",
    "  - \"Why is the data type important?\"\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "    - \"Describe how information is stored in a Python DataFrame.\"\n",
    "    - \"Define the two main types of data in Python: text and numerics.\"\n",
    "    - \"Examine the structure of a DataFrame.\"\n",
    "    - \"Modify the format of values in a DataFrame.\"\n",
    "    - \"Describe how data types impact operations.\"\n",
    "    - \"Define, manipulate, and interconvert integers and floats in Python.\"\n",
    "    - \"Analyze datasets having missing/null values (NaN values).\"\n",
    "    - \"Write manipulated data to a file.\"\n",
    "### Keypoints:\n",
    "    - \"Pandas uses other names for data types than Python, for example: `object` for textual data.\"\n",
    "    - \"A column in a DataFrame can only have one data type.\"\n",
    "    - \"The data type in a DataFrameâ€™s single column can be checked using `dtype`.\"\n",
    "    - \"Make conscious decisions about how to manage missing data.\"\n",
    "    - \"A DataFrame can be saved to a CSV file using the `to_csv` function.\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of individual columns and rows will impact analysis performed on a\n",
    "dataset read into python. For example, you can't perform mathematical\n",
    "calculations on a string (text formatted data). This might seem obvious,\n",
    "however sometimes numeric values are read into Python as strings. In this\n",
    "situation, when you then try to perform calculations on the string-formatted\n",
    "numeric data, you get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will review ways to explore and better understand the\n",
    "structure and format of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a\n",
    "DataFrame or a Python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of\n",
    "calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in\n",
    "this lesson: numeric and text data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A **floating point** (known as a\n",
    "float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For\n",
    "example: 1.13, 2.0, 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and\n",
    "floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data\n",
    "type so the decimal points are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus if we wanted to store 1.13 as\n",
    "an integer it would be stored as 1. Similarly, 1234.345 would be stored as 1234. You\n",
    "will often see the data type `Int64` in Python which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64\n",
    "simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively\n",
    "relates to how many digits it can store in each \"cell\". Allocating space ahead of time\n",
    "allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data type is known as Strings in Python, or Objects in Pandas. Strings can\n",
    "contain numbers and / or characters. For example, a string might be a word, a\n",
    "sentence, or several sentences. A Pandas object might also be a plot name like\n",
    "'plot1'. A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234'\n",
    "could be stored as a string. As could '10.23'. However **strings that contain\n",
    "numbers can not be used for mathematical operations**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas and base Python use slightly different names for data types. More on this\n",
    "is in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pandas Type | Native Python Type | Description |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| object | string | The most general dtype. Will be assigned to your column if column has mixed types (numbers and strings). |\n",
    "| int64  | int | Numeric characters. 64 refers to the memory allocated to hold this character. |\n",
    "| float64 | float | Numeric characters with decimals. If a column contains numbers and NaNs (see below), pandas will default to float64, in case your missing value has a decimal. |\n",
    "| datetime64, timedelta[ns] | N/A (but see the [datetime] module in Python's standard library) | Values meant to hold time data. Look into these for time series experiments. |\n",
    "\n",
    "[datetime]: http://doc.python.org/2/library/datetime.html\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking the format of our data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're armed with a basic understanding of numeric and text data\n",
    "types, let's explore the format of our survey data. We'll be working with the\n",
    "same `surveys.csv` dataset that we've used in previous lessons."
