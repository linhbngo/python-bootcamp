"['I have been to Yolk more times than I can count, and I am always happy with my meal. You can choose between white rice, brown rice, and lettuce as the base of your bowl, then select the toppings you would like. The rice is perfectly fried, the meat is never dry, and the vegetables are still kind of crunchy. The restaurant is family owned, and I find the servers very polite and efficient. Their noodles and BBQ are also good, but the bowls are the highlight. The only downside is that the electronic ordering system can be hard to work. Overall, I would recommend Yolk if you are looking for a causal place to enjoy some great Asian food. The setting is informal, so this is not the best place for, say, a business meeting.']",['Clare B.'],['\n        6/16/2019\n    '],['5.0 star rating'],"['Yolk Asian', 'Kitchen']"

We found each pretty flavorless and the servings small. The 6"" ID or so bowl had 3 separate items with a large base of rice. (If you don\'t mix your meal immediately, the rice at the bottom burns.) For similar money, we\'ll hit the hibachi at the China buffet across the street next time. Also, you have to enter your own order on kiosks squeezed between the tables. A lot of pressure to order when there is a line forming behind you. Better to view their menu online and make your choices before entering. Also $$$ for what you get. The whole experience seemed rushed and very impersonal. May\'s Asian Biestro that was there before was 1000x better.

""Now that\'s the right way to do it,"" he said pointing to the date/price sticker. \xa0We also grabbed a couple of Zapps potato chips and a bumper sticker to go. \xa0I\'ve never heard of Zapps potato chips, and I was intrigued by some of the flavors (e.g. Spicy Cajun Crawtators, Voodoo,Cajun Dill Gator-tators). \xa0I\'ve only had the Spicy Cajun Crawtators, and it was ok. \xa0If you like paprika and black pepper, a subtle sweet tang, you might like these, but don\'t expect to get any hint of crawdads...you\'ll be disappointed. \xa0Also, if the owner spots the bumper sticker on your car while he is out and about, he leaves a poker chip you can redeem for a free sandwich. \xa0For only a buck, why the heck not. \xa0The Pot Belly Deli also serves up various breakfast offerings, baked goods, and hot dishes like baked ziti. \xa0So, all-in-all, I would give this place three and a half stars. \xa0Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and pretty good food.']",['Cecilea M.'],['\n        10/22/2012\n    '],['4.0 star rating'],"['Pot Belly', 'Deli']"

"['I am probably just one of a few people in Clemson that does not care for the PBD dining experience. Their food tastes good, but in my opinion it\'s hard to mess up a sandwich. What I absolutely hate is the overall experience. From the minute you walk in the door you are heard like cattle in an abattoir to this narrow passageway. While you are in, what is quite often a very lengthy line, you need to be deciding what you want to eat because once you get to the order station, you feel rushed and hurried because of the multitudes of people behind you and impatient stares from the workers. Unfortunately deciding on what to order is a nearly impossible task unless you are a regular- there are two menus to choose from and neither are really useful. One is a big chalk board - where the selections are written in a micro font that is impossible to read until you are at the order station, and by then it is too late. It doesn\'t help that they use colored chalk that clashes with itself making reading all the more impossible. The other menu option is a paper menu that is available at the order station - again, at this point it is too late. I\'ve never felt like I had time to order what I really wanted and always feel like I just ordered something as a ""settle for"". In summary long lines, no useful menus, a general feeling of being rushed, and always coming away and a feeling of being cramped and herded like cattle keep this 20 year resident away from PDB.']",['Hook B.'],['\n        10/9/2015\n    '],['1.0 star rating'],"['Pot Belly', 'Deli']"

"['I graduated from Clemson a few years ago and if asked yesterday I would have given a five star review. I came in tonight with a few friends for a 6:30 reservation its now 9pm and we have just got our checks. We brought people from out of town and raved all day about our favorite Clemson restaurant. It took 15-20 minutes for anyone to even bring us water and once drinks were ordered it took another 20 minutes to get them. When we asked the waiter about the hold up he simply said said they were busy. When our appetizers came (before the drinks mind you) we were not given spoons for the soup and while every other tables got bread we did not until asked and when it arrived it was so incredibly hard it was inedible. We watched every table around us come and go until we got our entrees which were good for the most part with the exception of how the steaks were cooked and the fact we had to ask multiple times for steak knives. Once we finished we asked for the checks which took 45 minutes to arrive even after we spoke to a manager about the terrible service and she said she would take a few drinks off the check. They then told us they would take off one beer and only from the person that complained. We explained we were disappointed with that response and they told us they could only take off alcoholic beverages so for the five of us not drinking we were not compensated at all. At this point, we just wanted to leave the restaurant but another 30 minutes went by before we were brought the checks. To top the experience off when the checks came we noticed that everything was actually $1 more than listed on the menu which seems a bit unethical. Extremely disappointed with the experience all around but mainly the reaction from the managers and staff.']",['Nikki G.'],['\n        9/2/2018\n    '],['1.0 star rating'],"['Blue Heron Restaurant & Sushi', 'Bar']"

The French onion soup came with a little bit of cheese on salad croutons in lukewarm, bland soup, not the broiled, bubbly, melted goodness that properly prepared French onion should be. Our entrees came and we were very disappointed. My ribeye was salty and tough with 5 fingerling potato halves and a few green beans. The seafood salad came drenched in the cream sauce, with more chunks of cheese than seafood. The service was slow. The food was mediocre at best, and that\'s being generous.

It was entirely too much cinnamon. Mind you, I am a cinnamon lover! It tasted like spice and was very chalky. Remember the cinnamon challenge? That\'s what it felt like. I asked the employee if it was supposed to be chalky and she said ""yes because of the cake mix"". They were very hesitant to ask if I\'d like for them to remake it. I asked for another flavor and both employees said ""we really can\'t do that"". WHAT? I have worked in customer service for years. Never in my life have I told a customer ""no"". So what did I do? I PAID FOR ANOTHER ICE CREAM! And both employees were completely okay with it. These college student employees have absolutely no sense of customer and is truly sad. They even interact with the college students differently. We came to the conclusion that the employee didn\'t mix the ice cream well. All of the vanilla was on the bottom of my friend\'s ice cream. (See picture). Locals feed into these businesses. Train your employees on customer service. Teach them the importance of making sure the customer is 100% satisfied. Again, it wasn\'t even a matter of me ordering ice cream and just not liking it...my ice cream was DISGUSTING. I even read a review where an employee has remade an ice cream. In all honesty, I shouldn\'t have paid for another ice cream. But that was the last time I give this this location any of my business.

"['Food was great. ', 'Service was absolutely terrible. ', 'I always try to find reasons to tip my servers, even the littlest things. I did NOT tip my server at Zen Ramen and Sushi Burrito. There were several things that were just not okay.', '1. It wasn\'t a big deal at first, but their ice machine had been ""broken"" and wasn\'t making ice. My friend and I had asked for water and were given glasses of LUKEWARM water with no ice. You could probably get water from their bathroom sink colder than what they were serving. When our server came around the second time, we asked her for ice and she proceeded to inform us that their ice machine was down, so this was all she could offer. She apologized and it was whatever...that is until I saw her giving glasses of water WITH ice to other customers. **SHE LIED TO US** I asked a different server if they had ice and he told us they had no ice. **LIED TO US AGAIN** All through our visit, I saw servers bringing cups of water WITH ice out to other customers. Of course, it\'s just ice and it shouldn\'t be a big deal. Unless you\'re eating a bowl of HOT ramen and can only ""cool"" yourself down with a cup of lukewarm water, making your experience less enjoyable. On top of that, my very small cup was empty two to three times. And always refilled with lukewarm water. ', ""2. My friend ordered the Tonkotsu King and I ordered the Crunchy Salmon Sushi Burrito. She received her bowl about 30 minutes after ordering and I sat for another 10 minutes with nothing to eat before our server came and asked if we were missing anything. I told her I was missing my sushi burrito. She went back to the kitchen and told the staff. She came back after another 10 minutes and told me they had run out of salmon and that my order had not been made because they didn't have any. Two things wrong with that. When the kitchen receives an order and KNOWS they are out of something why would they not tell the wait staff so they could quickly replace the order? And why did it take so long for my server to realize we were missing a whole meal? "", '3. My friend did not receive any utensils other than a soup spoon with her bowl of ramen. How was she expected to eat her noodles? With her hands?? We had to ask for utensils. We also were not given any napkins. We asked twice and both times our server said she would bring it and never did. My friend eventually had to go to the bathroom and get TOILET PAPER. ', '4. Like I said, food was great. I ordered a fried chicken burrito since they were out of salmon, and I finished half of my burrito, and took a few bites out of the their half. It was good and I was full, so I wanted to take my leftovers home. I asked for a to go box TWICE. I waited about 20 minutes for ONE to go plate. Both times she said she would get it and never did. So, I basically spent $10 for HALF of a burrito. Not that big of a deal, but to some people it would be. My issue is that she never made it a priority to just grab a to go plate. ', ""Sometimes, SOME of these instances might occur on a normal visit. Maybe it's busy, maybe they were understaffed, right? NOPE. The place is SMALL. Kitchen had probably 4 people in it, and there were 3 servers. That, in my opinion is plenty of staff to maintain a relatively busy stream of customers properly.

He said he would have to do that for everyone if he did it for us... HELLO, its a small piece of crab leg.. we didn't want to waste $30 if she couldn't eat it.. so she didn't order them and ordered a burger instead, which she couldn't finish and requested a to go box. After she put her leftovers in the box, our waitress came over and said her manager/owner told her to move the box off the table so we wouldn't steal crab legs..REALLY? we just paid $400 to sit and eat all we could.

"['This past Saturday was my first and probably last visit to Tiger Town Tavern. As a Gamecock alumni and Greenville native I was excited to experience downtown Clemson with my boyfriend and other Clemson alumni friends and check out their favorite bar, but instead was greeted with some of the most hostile attitudes I\'ve experienced at any establishment. We joined our friends at TTTs after halftime on Saturday and were in line to purchase drinks and food and get ready to watch the rest of the game when I realized I had a mostly empty forgotten mini bottle in my back pocket. I removed the bottle to free up my pockets and search for a trash can to dispose of it since I much rather prefer a fresh mixed drink any day, and know mini bottles are a no go in bars. One of the workers there saw me pull it out and ordered I hand it over, which I did without hesitation since, as I mentioned before, I did not want it and was trying to get rid of it. Instead of letting us all carry on and purchase our drinks we were in line for I was then told to ""get the f**k out sweetie"" while being aggressively backed out of the bar. I explained I was trying to get rid of it and buy a drink and which only made him more aggressive towards me. When my boyfriend and friends noticed and asked what the problem was the only response was once again to ""get the f**k out."" We asked to speak to a manager to explain and that request was refused as we were pushed out of the bar. We were all also not at all intoxicated or belligerent in the slightest. We managed to get the bouncer at the door (the only friendly face in the place) \xa0to get the manager for us, and when she arrived and we tried to explain the response was ""leave or I\'ll call the cops."" \xa0 ', ""Now, I fully understand that you can't bring in outside alcohol, but this was an almost completely empty and \xa0forgotten mini bottle, which was immediately handed over to be disposed of. For the life of me I can't understand throwing out paying customers who would have happily been there buying food and drinks for several more hours, over something so small. In fact we would have probably gone back every time we were in town, but after this experience we'll be steering clear. We have all worked in the food and service industry and wouldn't dream of treating people with such hostility and disrespect, and I hope that others aren't treated the same.""]",['Julie N.'],['\n        9/30/2018\n    '],['1.0 star rating'],"['Tiger Town', 'Tavern']"

A few weeks ago a few of my girlfriends and I met up and went for sushi, waited over an hour and a half to get our food (which ended up ALL being wrong), the waitress came back with the same roll we said wasn't ours and argued with us that it was what we ordered, even after we confirmed it definitely was not (the girl who ordered hates cream cheese, it was a roll with cream cheese). After putting it on our table three times, realized it belonged to the table behind us, and gave it to them right after putting it on our table and it being out of the kitchen for over 15 minutes. When we did receive our food, two of ours were wrong, and she said she'd take it back, but we had already wasted two hours. The rolls were good, but not worth the wait. we messed up by requesting some rolls to go for our husbands, because they came back wrong too. When we paid, all of our checks were messed up. The rolls she messed up the second go around (we ordered the student discount rolls, for like maybe 10$) ended up being the most expensive rolls on the menu. We explained (again) that wasn't what we ordered, and she took it back charging us for the rolls we ordered. Comes back with check, wrong AGAIN. It took at least 5x before we got an accurate check. It was mind blowing how slow and unbothered the staff was and our mistake for even coming to the place to begin with.

"['China Express is definitely the best Chinese place for miles around, although you wouldn\'t expect that by the name or the nondescript strip-mall location. You might get a tip if you look in the window during any mealtime, though, and notice the plastic tables packed full of international students gobbling down the closest thing to comfort food they can find around here. They come not for the usual Chinese-American menu (all of which China Express executes well enough, for those who are into that kind of thing) but for the more authentically Chinese offerings. The latter used to be doled out quietly on a ""secret menu"" basis - customers in the know were handed a short list of options handwritten in Chinese. Now, however, a full wall of the restaurant is covered with photographs and English names of most of the old secret-menu items. My dining partner and I come in multiple times a week in the process of trying everything on the menu. (I think we\'ve become some of the more amusing regulars.) Not everything is flawless - the mapo tofu uses the wrong kind of tofu and isn\'t quite Szechuan enough - but most of what we\'ve tried has been delicious and quite similar to the dishes we loved in Flushing (Queens, NY) and have longed for ever since moving south. My favorite is the ""water boiled fish,"" unctiously tender morsels in pungent Szechuan sauce. My dining partner favors the tofu eggplant pot and the beef tendon noodles. The option to dine-in off pretty Corelle plates is nice, especially when we\'re served by the brisk proprietress who asks where on earth we come from and why we like each other so darn much.']",['Christine B.'],['\n        8/12/2015\n    '],['5.0 star rating'],"['China', 'Express']"

He then said, ""I won\'t charge for the chips. What do you want?"" I ordered and the sandwich was wrong again. The fourth time I asked if he would mind reading the order back to me and before I could finish asking him to do this he loudly interrupted me speaking very rapidly.

He responded saying he ""ran three hundred orders a day and they can\'t all be right"". I said I understood. It was wrong again. So, I called and asked for the manager which is when I discovered that was who I\'d been talking to all along. So, I said, ""do you remember when I asked you to read...."" That was all I could get out before he screamed, ""WHEN YOU DIDN\'T TELL ME IT WAS WRONG???!!"" I told him I was coming to get my money back and hung up. I get there and ask for the manager and was pointed to Matt. I walked up and told him not to scream at me when I try to ask a question. He then says, ""are you the guy on the phone?"" I said yes and said I wanted my money back. He tried to apologize and I said I just wanted my money back. He then said, ""You are such an idiot. Where did you go to college.... Lemme guess YOU DIDN\'T GO TO COLLEGE!"". I informed him that I was a student here at this University. Then he called me a ""redneck"" and asked, ""which NASCAR is your favorite?"".

I left and the next morning I get a call from the local police that I need to come sign a trespass notice. So, I found out who the owner was and called him to ask that he please look at the video of what transpired and then see if he still feels I need to sign the notice.

I said okay but before I could hang up he explained that I could still buy from him but I needed to do it online under an assumed name..... Hard to believe but true.

Half of the TVs were running the Indiana- Michigan State basketball game on ESPN, which I did not have a problem of, but on the second TV was CNN's news coverage. Being an apolitical man as myself, I did not have a problem that specifically CNN was on, but since most Pizza Huts have more of a bar-esque atmosphere, one would expect to see another sports game on (as I'm such that there was more sporting events occurring at the time than just that one college basketball game). Now we would have asked our waitress to change the channel, but we really did only see her about a total of three times."", 'We obviously had a significant amount of time to watch CNN and the Indiana- Michigan State basketball game (we were at the restaurant for the entirety of the game (almost two whole hours)), as we waited over an hour just for our food.

The cheese sticks were pretty good, very cheesy and garlicky. The pizza was decent, nothing that extraordinary comes from Pizza Hut, but the crust was slathered in a significant amount of their garlic butter sauce and it kinda ruined the crust.', 'When we were done eating, we just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible, so we got ourselves a take home box and we waited in line at the cash register to pay for our food.
